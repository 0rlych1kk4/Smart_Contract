# Smart_Contract
This shows how to start a local Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) in Rust, query balance, and make simple transactions
Before writing any code, we need to make sure we have some required tools installed, specifically Rust and Ganache.
Install Rust by following the instructions. Or if you are using Arch Linux you can follow the instructions here to install Rust.
ganache-cli
Ganache helps you quickly set up an Ethereum environment for testing. If you donâ€™t want the whole bundle, you can just install ganache-cli using npm,
npm install -g ganache
Run ganache-cli to check if you've installed it correctly.
